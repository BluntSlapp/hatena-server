Hatena server - by pbsds
======

This is a replacement for the Flipnote Hatena service for the DSi which has ended.
It's written in Python 2.7 and requires Twisted
Future versions could need PIL aswell
This project uses Hatenatools, also written by me. It can be found here: http://pbsds.net/projects/hatenatools

To use it, simply run server.py
On the DSi, set the proxy settings to point to this server on port 8080, then access Flipnote Studio as usual.

I plan on hosting an "official" server of this on hatena.pbsds.net port 8080, but that will have to come later.
I only have a 5Mbps uplink, so if anyone would like to volunteer a server, please contact me at pbsds@hotmail.com
